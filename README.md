# TasteTrail
Explore and share recipes based on regional specialties and ingredients.
Concept:
This app lets users share recipes, but it also highlights the nutritional content and suggests local substitutes for ingredients. Users can share recipes with their community, view nearby popular recipes, and discover nutritional information. It encourages local, healthy eating based on seasonal ingredients and cultural diversity.

Key Features:

    User Authentication: Users sign up, create profiles, and follow other users in the community.

    Recipe Sharing:
        Users can submit recipes with a description, ingredients, instructions, and photos.
        Ingredients can be tagged with local names and nutritional values.

    Location-Based Recipe Discovery:
        Recipes are tagged with the user’s location.
        Users can explore what’s popular in their area or discover regional recipes.

    Nutrition Analysis:
        The backend can analyze the nutritional content of each recipe (like calories, protein, carbs, etc.) based on ingredients provided.
        Users can set dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free) and view relevant recipes.

    Ingredient Substitution Suggestions:
        The app suggests ingredient substitutions based on local availability and dietary restrictions.
        Example: if the recipe calls for something rare or expensive, it suggests cheaper or more accessible local alternatives.

    Recipe Collections:
        Users can save recipes to custom collections (e.g., “High-Protein,” “Budget-Friendly,” “Quick Meals”).

    Weekly Local Ingredient Guide:
        Based on the user’s location, the app provides a list of seasonal ingredients available in local markets and suggests recipes to make with them.

    Community Ratings and Feedback:
        Users can rate recipes and give feedback. They can also share their versions or tweaks, which encourages community interaction.

Tech Stack:

    Backend (Django):
        Django REST framework for the API.
        Use Python libraries like django-nutrition (if available) or external APIs for basic nutritional analysis.
    Frontend (React):
        React for the user interface.
        A map view (using Google Maps or Leaflet) to showcase popular recipes by location.
        Optional: Integrate a frontend library for nutrition labeling.

Additional Add-Ons:

    Social Sharing: Let users share recipes on social media.
    Push Notifications: Notify users of seasonal ingredients or popular new recipes in their area.

This app idea combines social and practical elements, giving it a unique and local flavor while helping users explore new recipes and make healthier choices with local ingredients.
